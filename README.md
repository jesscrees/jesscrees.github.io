# Personal Site

I remade my personal site in March 2021 when I realised that it no longer suited my needs. My old site fulfilled its purpose in showcasing my experience and references and helped my various job searches over the years. But now I decided it was time for something different.

I wanted something simple and accessible that told people my current job, education, and where they could go to see my content. I had been putting off redoing this site for months because I kept thinking that I needed to host my code demos and blog posts myself, but that was just slowing me down from doing what I really wanted to do. Actually code and write!
